# San-Fransisco-Air-Port-Clustering
- In this notebook, we focus on analyzing and preprocessing air traffic passenger statistics from San Francisco Airport.
- The dataset includes multiple features related to airlines, geographic regions, and passenger movements.
- Our main objective is to clean the data, address missing values, and conduct clustering analysis to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.
- To accomplish this, we will apply methods such as data imputation, feature engineering, and clustering techniques like KMeans.
